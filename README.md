# ExcelAlamazeMap

I did not create this spreadsheet. It was created by Thudargh. I am just controlling it here 
so that I can post releases on bintray so that other players can access download it rather than
having to email Thudargh directly and wait for a reply.

I saw in a recent post that there may be some interest in an Excel-based version of the Alamaze map.  I've actually developed such a map, along with a method of tracking my orders & resources by turn.  It's certainly not as nice looking as the PowerPoint map and I'm sure most of the instructions on how to use it are just in my head rather than written down, but I thought I would share it anyway.

Version 2.0 is now available, but can't be posted to the forum because it is macro-enabled. It can load in the DAT save files from the TurnParser, or be used independently. I've included some written instructions. I'm not sure it adds much if anything beyond what the TurnParser does, but if you like Excel spreadsheets, here you go! Besides, it was fun to develop.
